# cpputil

**cpputil** is a collection of code snippets I write at my spare time to be fluent in C++.

Namely, I implement parts of the standard library, rewrite and extend StackOverflow answers which seemed interesting to me, play with modern C++ features and do other things which I usually have no time to deal with at work :)
